1. I will use the past labs in this project to gather information about the
input files using stat, the directory functions, and permissions. I also need
to be able to use handle errors and find paths.

2. I will use a linked list to store my paths. I also need to use a tree to store
files and other data. 

3. I will be using the following algorithms"
    -loops to traverse through directory
    -USTAR
    

4. subroutines:
    -permissions()
    -for each flag
    
5. I will makes sure to unittest and system test all my functions and processes
periodically, as well as making sure my valgrind passes.
